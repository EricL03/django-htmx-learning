# django-htmx-learning
This is a project I made to further my understanding of Django and HTMX. 
It is based on an already functioning calculator, written in "basic" html, css and javascript. 
In this project I have integrated it into a django-backend and also used HTMX to make a history page
where expressions and their result is stored. The history page is loaded by pressing the H (history)
button on the calculator, you can then return by pressing the "return" button

## TODOs:
* Clean up after late gitignore implementation
* Research about authentication using django-admin
* Research about CSRF-tokens 
* Research about other secret password in the code...
